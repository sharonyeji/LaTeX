[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-cs510-2016f/cw-01-YOURNAME.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-cs510-2016f/cw-01-YOURNAME)

**Due date:** 2016/09/06

## Specification

Complete the following exercises, saving your solutions in the indicated files. For Python files that include test functions, GitHub will automatically run your tests with ```nosetests``` on every commit, indicating any failures via the Travis framework in the build status image above.

1. In SageCloud, create a LaTeX file ```testlatex.tex``` (using the template in the ```info``` repository). In this file write an explanation of what the definition of the derivative $f'(x)$ of a function $f(x)$ means.  Include both inline and numbered equations, as well as a proper title, abstract, and section headings. Find a suitable image to illustrate your definition online, and include it as a figure, with proper citation of the source. After ensuring that your LaTeX file compiles properly to pdf, commit only the source file ```testlatex.tex``` to GitHub in this repository.
1. In SageCloud, create a python file ```testpython.py```. In this file write only a single function ```test_trivial()``` that contains only the line ```assert True```. Commit this python file to GitHub in this repository and ensure that the Travis tests detect it and report a passing status. You will need to edit the links in this README file and commit the changes to GitHub to see the Travis status image.
1. In SageCloud, create a Sage Math Worksheet ```testsage.sagews```. Explore the menus to see what it can do, and demonstrate a few neat examples that you like. Give the document a properly formatted header and sections, as well as some text describing what you chose and why. Commit the file to GitHub in this repository.
